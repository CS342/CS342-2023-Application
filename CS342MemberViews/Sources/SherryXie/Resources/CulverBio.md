I went to high school for four years in Culver, a small town in the northwest corner of Indiana. Although the town situates itself in the middle of nowhere, the school I went to borders Lake Maxinkuckee (an actual lake which dwarfs Lake Lag). Over the summer, I like water skiing and sailing on the lake and during winter, it was a prime location for snow fights. If you ever happen to be in Indiana, make sure you check it out!
