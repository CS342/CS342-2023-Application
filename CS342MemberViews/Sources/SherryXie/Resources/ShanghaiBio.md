I was born and raised in Shanghai, arguably the largest metropolitan city in China. By far my favorite city in the world, it boasts both traditional Chinese and distinctly European archiecture from the colonial times. It has great touristy attractions such as the Bund, the Oriental TV Tower, and it has amazing food from all over the world. I would highly recommend everyone to visit and please hit me up if you're there!
