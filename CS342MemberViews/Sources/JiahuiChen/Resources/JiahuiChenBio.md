Hi! I am a junior studying Computer Science at Stanford. As an aspiring effective altruist, I am looking for ways to maximize my impact on the worldâ€™s most pressing problems through my study and future career. 

At this point in my undergraduate career, my focus has been to gain career capital and transferable skills while furthering my studies. In the next few years, I am eager to take any opportunity where I can gain fresh perspectives and learn new skills. I am mostly interested in AR/VR, Natural Language Processing, and product design. 

In the long run, I am seeking to combine my experience of living and studying in both China and the US, my interest in tech and entrepreneurship, and my passion for doing the most good into a career that is both a personal niche and an effective service to the present and future people.

Hit me up if you are interested in chatting about effective altruism, China-related topics, emerging techs, new products, or just want to get some Netflix recommendations. You can also visit my personal website (jchen23-stf.github.io) to see more of my writings, photography, and technical blogs:)
