Hamed Hekmat is a sophomore undergraduate at Stanford University. Though currently undeclared, he's heavily considering majoring in Symbolic Systems with a concentration in Artifical Intelligence. He's particularly interested in how such technologies can be applied to improve existing systems/methods, especially within the healthcare sphere, which is what brings him to this class!

When he's not busy with student life, he enjoys listening to music, playing/watching basketball, and spending time with friends and family. Some albums from this past year he recommends checking out (especially if you're a fan of hip hop) include JID's 'The Forever Story', Smino's 'Luv 4 Rent', Denzel Curry's 'Melt My Eyez See Your Future', and Freddie Gibbs's '$oul $old $eparately'. He's looking forward to getting to know y'all!
