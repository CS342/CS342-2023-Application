I am a sophomore studying Biomedical Computation. On campus, I'm doing computational genetics research in the [Hunter Fraser Lab](https://web.stanford.edu/~hbfraser/), and I'm a member of Stanford Symphony Orchestra, the chamber music program Stanford Lion Dance, and Music + Mentorship. In my free time, I enjoy baking, graphic design, photography, martial arts, and reading memoirs/historical fiction.
