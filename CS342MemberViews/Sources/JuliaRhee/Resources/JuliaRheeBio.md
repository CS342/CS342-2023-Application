Hello! My name is Julia and I am a sophomore at Stanford hailing from Atlanta, Georgia. My mom works as an internist, so I have always been interested in healthcare innovation after spending many hours at the dining table learning about inefficiencies in patient treatment and digital health systems. I'm studying Computer Science because I hope to build solutions to problems on my own, so I'm super excited to finally put these skills to practice in this class on the Pediatric Apple Watch Team!

Outside of the classroom, I spend lots of time finding ways to stay active as a washed-up high school athlete, whether that be hitting the slopes with the Stanford Ski Team, surfing on the weekends, or playing basketball on the Stanford Club team. I love thrifting, anything produced by Mindy Kaling, and The Cure. I'm broadly interested in digital health, the intersection between tech and media/consumer goods, growth equity, and entrepreneurship, so I'd love to chat if any of our interests align.
