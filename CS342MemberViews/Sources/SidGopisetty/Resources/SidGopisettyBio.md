Hello! My name is Sidharth Gopisetty, Sid for short. I am from Sacramento and am currentl a sophomore majoring in Electrical Engineering with a scope on biological applications. Beyond engineering, I have a love for community service and fashion.

Within Fashion, I hope yo pivot furhter into sustainable fashion and bring that mindset to campus via both activities and advocation. I am also a clothing and website deisgner with extensive experience in photoshop. I thoroughly enjoy utilzing color theory and sciences to produce the most intentional outcomes.
