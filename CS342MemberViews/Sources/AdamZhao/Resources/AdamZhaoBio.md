Adam Zhao is a sophomore majoring Computer Science on the AI track and minoring in Music. His current interests include getting enough sleep during the week, maxing out his Romanian Deadlifts,and curbing his borderline crippling caffeine addiction. When he's not dying from a pset(programming), you can find him in the Braun practice rooms improving his cello skills.

Adam's academic interests lie primarily in the application of ML to various industries, including but not limited to education, healthcare, and music. He is uncertain about his future in industry/academia and would greatly appreciate if people who have experienced both could share their opinion on the matter.
