Hey everyone! My name is Riya and I'm from Toronto, Canada. I'm a Sophomore at Stanford studying CS with a focus on Computational Biology and am planning to minor in Product Design. I'm really interested in the intersection of technology and medical devices to help improve quality of life and healthspans for vulnerable populations, and love working on projects in the space. In my free time, I love to backpack, hike, travel, paint, and do water sports and activities. This past summer, I was backpacking across Portugal and Spain. Here's one of my favourite memories below!
