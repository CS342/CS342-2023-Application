I'm a sophomore majoring in Mathematical and Computational Science, and I'm interested in applying data science to problems with social impact. In the past, I've worked on health tech solutions, election integrity research, and public policy research. I'm taking this class because I'm really interested in learning how to use CardinalKit to apply it to the digital health research I'm currently working on. 

I grew up in Bangalore, India, and spent time after high school working as a police officer for the Singapore Police Force. I enjoy football (soccer), books (all kinds), boxing (non-Youtube), and music (rap/indie rock/indie folk).
